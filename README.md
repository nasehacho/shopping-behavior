# Shopping-Behavior

As a junior data analyst at a fast-growing online shopping company headquartered in Bengaluru, India, FlashFash.  I am tasked with getting an understanding of the American market, by analyzing the shopping behavior of consumers.

Particularly would like to discover the "seasonality" of shoppers, which demographics buy the most, and which market outreach strategies we can apply to maximize purchases.

This project aims to simulate the common workflows done in data analysis which include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis 
2. Data Transformation 
3. Analysis of Transformed Data 

## Observations 

The project generally allowed the in-depth review on how data analysis with python (pandas) can be performed. Starting with exploratory data analysis, general patterns of the data set were concluded such as the presence of a normal distribution curve for the "Purchase Amount" column. However within the EDA, it could be seen that there had been many null values apparents in certain columns. As such, data transformation was performed to clean the data to provide a more effective analysis. Finally, after saving the cleaned data to a new .csv file, further analysis was performed that relied on previous findings from the EDA such as the t-test conducted for the "Purchase Amount" column due to it showcasing a normal distribution. 

## Challenges 

Understanding how to formulate a null and alternate hypothesis for t-testing

## Possible Next Actions

After understanding the American market, the online shopping company can inplace marketing strategies determined to be effective from this data analysis. Further analysis can be performed on the marketing strategies that were agreed to take place to determine it's effectiveness.
